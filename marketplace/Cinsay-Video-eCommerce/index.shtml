                    <p>As simple as 1-2-3<br/>
                    Or as we like to call it: <span class="orange">WATCH.SHOP.SHARE&trade;</span></p>
                    <h2 class="orange">WATCH</h2>
                    <h3>Watch on Websites, Blogs, Social Media, and Emails</h3>
                    <p>It's easy for anyone to view your video on any website. Once you have uploaded, it can be easily embedded and viewed by your customers. Here is an example of Mario Andretti's video embedded on his shop website, <a href="http://www.ShopMarioA.com" target="_blank">ShopMarioA.com</a>, as well as Andretti Auto Sports (<a href="http://www.ShopAndretti.com" target="_blank">ShopAndretti.com</a>) and Strokers Dallas (<a href="http://www.ShopStrokersDallas.com" target="_blank">ShopStrokersDallas.com</a>)</p>
                    <h3>Watch in Social Media Worldwide</h3>
                    <p>Your potential and existing customers can watch your video in social media networks worldwide. They can clearly see your video on your profile, timeline, or a specific page you have dedicated for your business within a social media network.</p>
                    <h3>Watch in Emails</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>You and your customer can view and share your video via email.</li>
                      <li>Cinsay has built the sharing feature right into the video player.  Simply click the share link, choose email and cut and paste your email addresses.</li> 
                      <li>Each message has a pre-populated 'call to action' share message that you can use or customize.</li>
                      <li>Since over 50% of emails are read on mobile, Cinsay has also optimized email links to play on any mobile device.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="orange">SHOP</h2>
                    <h3>In-Player Transactions</h3>
                    <p>Images of your products appear in the bottom of your video. As your customers mouse over the product images, they expand for easier viewing.

                    <h3>Donations</h3>
                    <p>The most successful way to generate donations is while your supporters are watching your video. As they mouse over the donate image in the bottom of the video, it will expand to show them a bigger image and a brief description. After they click on it, a full description about your cause and donation amounts will be displayed in the video. They simply choose the amount they want to donate and click “Next.”  They will enter their contact information and their payment information. Once they have submitted their donation, you will be immediately notified via email.</p>

                    <h2 class="orange">SHARE</h2>
